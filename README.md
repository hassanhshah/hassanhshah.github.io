## [Predicting Squirrel Movements in Central Park](https://github.com/hassanhshah/Squirrel_Prediction)
* Fit an XGBoost Model on data from the movements of squirrels in Central Park using a variety of methods, including GPS tracking and camera traps
* Also used tree-based models to assess the relative importance of various features
* Ultimately, the most predictive feature proved to be whether or not the squirrel ran away from the observer
